# Tales of Twitter
What if we could see the sentiments of people through the breadcrumbs they leave on TwitterÂ ?

## Quick Access Links

This project is described in details in [this article](https://medium.com/@redouane.achouri/twitter-sentiment-analysis-a-tale-of-stream-processing-8fd92e19a6e6).

## Deployment

Local and live deployement are done through the same [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file.

Compose offers a way to control the order of statup and shutdown of containers through the `depends_on` option, but, by design, [there is no way to delay statup until a service becomes available](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/) - unless we run a script that waits for a service to become available with a `command` option.

> The problem of waiting for a database (for example) to be ready is really just a subset of a much larger problem of distributed systems. In production, your database could become unavailable or move hosts at any time. Your application needs to be resilient to these types of failures.

> To handle this, design your application to attempt to re-establish a connection to the database after a failure. If the application retries the connection, it can eventually connect to the database.

Services need to be started in a specific order with the following commands:
```
# Start Kafka and InfluxDB
docker-compose up -d kafka influxdb

# Start Grafana
docker-compose up -d grafana

# Start the producer and the consumer
docker-compose up -d producer consumer
```
